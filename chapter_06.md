## Chapter 6
“Shit Ajax,” Jackhammer said, “It’s been two weeks since Phanik left man.”

“I know man,” Ajax said, “he’ll be back, he is just taking an extended vacation, if he isn’t back in two days then we will go search for him.”

“Ok man.” Jackhammer said as he went back to his work out.

Two days later Phanik still hasn’t come back, now the guys are worried and Ajax has gathered his men and has split them into two squads.

“Alpha team search areas North and West of here.” Ajax said to Slick, Gorn, and Arod. “Bravo team search areas South and East of here.” He said to Jackhammer, Crosshair, and Crucifix. “I’ll search the central area, if I take the 929RR I’ll cover more ground weaving in and out.” Ajax concluded.

“Should we take separate vehicles?” Gorn asked.

“Affirmative,” Ajax stated, “You’ll cover more ground in a less amount of time, alright men let’s move out.”

“Sir Yes Sir,” the platoon toned in unison.

Ajax jumped on his Honda 929RR and took off. Gorn hopped into his Mazda RX-7, Crosshair with his Hummer, Crucifix with his chopper, and Jackhammer with his Porsche. They all took off in different directions not knowing what they would find if anything.
