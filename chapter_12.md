## Chapter 12
“Error!? How is it a mother fucking error!?” Ajax yelled as he hit the table. He was so mad that he picked up the two-ton machine and threw it across the room like it was nothing. The room fell silent like they had just seen a miracle. “Guys?” Ajax asked.

“Yeah?” they responded.

“Did I just throw a two-ton machine across the room by myself?” Ajax questioned.

“Uh-huh” They responded while shaking their heads up and down.

“How was that physically possible?” Ajax asked.

“No Clue,” the guys said.

Just then the door blew open with a loud thud as it hit the wall and in strolled Phanik; like nothing had happened at all. As he was walking in he noticed several red dots pointed at his chest aiming to kill him.

“Now is that any way to welcome me back?” Phanik said with a chuckle.

“Phanik!” all the guys yelled as they put down their guns and rushed over to welcome their comrade back. That is, everyone but Ajax who remained behind; less than thrilled for his brother to be back.
