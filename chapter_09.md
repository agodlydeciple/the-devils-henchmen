## Chapter 9
“C’mon you call that torture!?” Phanik yelled as the giant pendulum swung closer and closer to his stomach.

“In thirty seconds this blade will slice through your entire body, spewing blood and body parts everywhere,” Nilap Haras explained.

“And your point is?” Phanik asked, “Lady I hate to burst your bubble, but I’m an expert on every form of torture device known to man. This means that I can get out of this with no problem.”

“Ha! That’s what you think. Your restraints are made up of a special alloy that cannot be broken or cut by anything man made,” Haras said with a grin.

“Once again you underestimate my intellect, not only am I a super genius; but I’m not human either. Bet you didn’t see that one coming. And here is the icing on the cake, this entire time I’ve been signaling my platoon telepathically, they will be here in the next ten to twenty minutes, so basically you’re fucked,” Phanik said sonically. Just then his face became very stern and the lights started flickering. Then out of nowhere Phanik was levitating in mid air. Still strapped to the table he floated up to the control room and looked deeply into Haras Nilap’s eyes. He then winked and an explosion occurred causing the glass to shatter and Haras and her guards were slammed up against the walls rendering them unconscious.

Phanik then used the remaining amount of mind power to break the restraints; he then levitated into the control room and walked out the door.
