## Chapter 11
As Phanik shielded his eyes from the blinding sun light he realized where he was. He was but a mere five or six miles out of town, give or take a few feet. So he started jogging and before he knew it he was speeding at eighty miles an hour without even breaking a sweat.

He then skidded to a stop, to only realize that he had gone through the entire city in a matter of seconds. “Damn it all to hell,” he said out loud as he started running again. Except this time instead of running straight through the city, he was greeted with a battalion of Nilap Robotic Units or PRU’s. There were at least eight of them, all equipped with 50 cal machine guns and 45 caliber pistols. “Fuck my life,” he said as he skidded to a stop. “Why are you guys always up in my shit?” he demanded.

“What is your shit?” they droned in robotic harmony. “We must terminate the one called Phanik,” they droned again.

“Go fuck yourself!” Phanik yelled as the PRU’s opened fire on him. He then threw his hands in up in front of him and the bullets stopped in their track. Then he did a push up motion with his hands and the bullets pulled a 180 and hit the PRU’s point blank; one by one they fell and exploded.

“Finally!” Phanik exclaimed as he took off toward the bunkers secluded area.
