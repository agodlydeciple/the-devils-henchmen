Ajax and Jackhammer got up and got the rest of the platoon together. In total there are eight of us, Ajax the leader, Jackhammer the muscle, Slick the mechanic, Crosshair the weapons specialist, Crucifix the mercenary, Arod the driver, Gorn the navigator, and Phanik the brain. All of us have had military experience and years of service, which is what makes us all so deadly. And on top of it all we are all related in one way or another.
