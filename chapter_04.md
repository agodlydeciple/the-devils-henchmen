## Chapter 4
“Ajax come take a look at this,” Phanik said looking at the screen of security cameras. “What do u make of this?” he said pointing.

“Man I don’t fucking know, you’re the computer whiz,” Ajax said.

“You don’t need to be a fucking computer whiz to look at a fucking screen wise-ass,” Phanik said.

“I can’t tell what it is that’s moving, and the scanners are saying it is of unknown origin”.

“Shit it’s huge!” Jackhammer yelled as he was wiping sweat off his forehead. “Guys come take a look at this” he said to the rest of the guys sitting down.

“It’s what? 120 ft in size?” Crucifix guessed.

“Try doubling that,” Phanik said.

“What can be 240 ft big?” Crosshair said.

“A freight ship?” slick said.

“Like I fucking said….it’s of unknown origin!” Phanik yelled. “None of you assholes ever listen to what I’m saying”.

“Hey Ajax….did you hear someone talking?” Arod said.

“That’s it!” Phanik yelled fuming, “I’m fucking gone, and you jerks can do your own computer work”.

Phanik stormed off into his room slamming his door shut and appearing several moments later with a packed bag. He jumped into his 1969 fully restored Dodge Charger and took off.

“Now you’ve done it!” Ajax yelled at Arod. “You know he was on edge, why did you have to fucking go and do it? Explain yourself”.

“Man I was just playing, I didn’t think he would blow up like a girl;” Arod said. “He will be back, he always comes back”.

“I don’t think so man,” Ajax said; “I’ve never seen Phanik so steamed”.
