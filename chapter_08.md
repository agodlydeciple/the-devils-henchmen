Its 2300 hours and the entire platoon returned from searching. “Report,” Ajax said jumping off his bike.

“Alpha team recovered nothing,” Slick reported.

“How about Bravo team, did you guys recover anything?” Ajax questioned.

“Bravo team discovered a blood trail, we brought back samples for testing,” Jackhammer said.

“Well what the fuck are you waiting for?” Ajax demanded.

“Well we need to use the computer to run the samples.” Jackhammer said.

“Yeah, so what’s the problem?” Ajax demanded starting to get angrier

“Well….um….I don’t know how to say this,” Jackhammer said, “but none of us knows how to use Phanik’s equipment.”

“Oh what the fuck,” Ajax yelled, “All this damn equipment and not a single one of us can use it! This is bullshit! FUCK!” Ajax fumed.

Ajax stormed off into his room slamming stuff around.

“Man, I’ve never seen Ajax that pissed off,” Gorn said, “So we will replace Phanik with a new platoon member. Phanik knew the repercussions of leaving the hideout alone,” Gorn continued.

“It’s not that easy,” Jackhammer said. “You can’t just replace Phanik,” he continued, “There are some things you don’t know about Ajax and Phanik, not only have they served together for years, but Phanik is Ajax’s older brother, now I know you can’t tell because they don’t look anything alike, but Phanik is almost two years older and Ajax may look tougher, but Phanik will take him any day,” He finished.
